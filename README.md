# Effects of Signal Variation on Visual Pattern Detection Under Fixed and Variable Noise 


## Summary

This study investigates how signal uncertainty affects the detection of simple and complex visual patterns. Participants completed a two-interval forced-choice task, detecting either sinusoidal gratings or band-limited noise textures. Signal uncertainty was manipulated by presenting either a single signal type or one of five variations per trial. Additionally, noise was either fixed across trials or varied.

Contrast thresholds were measured to assess detection performance under these conditions, providing insight into how uncertainty influences the perception of structured and complex patterns.
